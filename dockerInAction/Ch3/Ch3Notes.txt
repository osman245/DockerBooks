git clone https://github.com/dockerinaction/ch3_dockerfile.git
docker build -t dia_ch3/dockerfile:latest ch3_dockerfile
--> In this example, you copy the project from a 
public source repository onto your computer and then 
build and install a Docker image by using the Dockerfile
 included with
that project


manually load images from a file...
docker pull busybox:latest
docker save -o myfile.tar busybox:latest
docker rmi busybox
docker load –i myfile.tar


docker rmi dia_ch3/dockerfile
rm -rf ch3_dockerfile
--> remove image and rm container forcefully.

image === a collection of image layers
layer is a set of files and file metadata that is package and distributed as an atomic unit.

Summary:

Human users of Docker use repository names to communicate which software
they would like Docker to install.
 Docker Hub is the default Docker registry. You can find software on Docker
Hub through either the website or the docker command-line program.
 The docker command-line program makes it simple to install software that’s
distributed through alternative registries or in other forms.
 The image repository specification includes a registry host field.
 The docker load and docker save commands can be used to load and save
images from TAR archives.
 Distributing a Dockerfile with a project simplifies image builds on user machines.
 Images are usually related to other images in parent/child relationships. These
relationships form layers. When we say that we have installed an image, we are
saying that we have installed a target image and each image layer in its lineage.
 Structuring images with layers enables layer reuse and saves bandwidth during
distribution and storage space on your computer and image distribution servers.
